## TL;DR ‚Äî What I built & automated

- üß© **Accounts microservice** (Python/Flask) packaged as a container.
- ‚ò∏Ô∏è **Kubernetes/OpenShift** deployment with a public **Route + TLS**.
- ü§ñ **Tekton CD pipeline**: `clone ‚Üí lint ‚Üí tests ‚Üí buildah image ‚Üí deploy`
  - Shared **PVC** workspace
  - **GitHub auth** via Kubernetes `Secret`
- üß™ **Tests**: unit & API (nose) with coverage (lab run: *24 tests, ~94%*).
- üîí **Security**: added security headers at the Route; ran **Bandit** and **Safety**.
- üìã **Workflow**: feature branch ‚Üí PR ‚Üí merge ‚Üí rollout; everything in Git.
