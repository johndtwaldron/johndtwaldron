👋 Hi, I’m John Waldron (JDW)

⚡ From mainframes to multisig — I’m building my career at the intersection of legacy engineering, modern QA and Bitcoin’s frontier.  

🌱 Currently:  
- Transitioning from 7+ years as an IBM MQ Lab Advocate (z/OS, banking infra) into full-time Bitcoin engineering.  
- Focused on **Quality Assurance, testing, and documentation** across various projects.  
- Learning all sorts, right now mainly Python/Playwright/Rust experience.

🔭 Proof of Work so far:  
- ₿OSS Program (Chaincode Labs) — active in Bitcoin Core scripting & test challenges.  
- Base58 Bitcoin Transactions Protocol Course — hand-parsing transactions, P2SH/P2WSH scripts.  
- Published advocacy on Bitcoin nation-state adoption (Ireland GE2024).  
- Contributor at BitVocation, Crypto Academy, BitVault and Bitcoin open-source discussions.  

👯 Looking to collaborate on:  
- QA/testing harnesses for projects (Python, Playwright, Bitcoin, Swift, Rust,).  
- Documentation, test vectors, ci/cd, and onboarding guides.  
- Developer advocacy and education — translating complex systems into clear narratives.

⚡ Fun fact:  
I reinterpret “IBM” as “Irish ₿itcoin Man” — marrying my past with my future.
